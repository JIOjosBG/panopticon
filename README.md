# PANOPTICON
## Your trusted Web3 Newsletter Board
### Stay informed with the latest insights in blockchain and crypto with Panopticon


## Getting Started

First, run the frontend on the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Run the server on a separate terminal by doing:

```bash
cd server
node index.js
```

## Usage

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser (yes, for now we only have localhost. Deployment coming soon) to discover the amazing world of Panopticon, the first web3-only newsletter board, catering the best and most insightful newsletters in the crypto space.

To subscribe to your preferred crypto newsletter, click on the Subscribe button. You should sign two different transactions, one for encrypting your email address and the second one to grant access to the organization behind the newsletter to send you regular newsletters.

Once both transactions have been signed and are confirmed on the blockchain, you should get a confirmation email after few minutes confirming your new subscription as well as including the previous newsletter for you to have some good read material while you wait for the next newsletter to be timely delivered to you.
